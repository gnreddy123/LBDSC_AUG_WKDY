Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[76] It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.

Hello Pythonfers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[77] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[78]

Its core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[79]

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
